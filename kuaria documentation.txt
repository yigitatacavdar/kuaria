current feature document 13/09/2025

3 main parts are required for the program to exist

the scanner:

- auto scans common subnets, if no hosts found, asks user to input the desired subnet.
- retrieves active ips, port 22 states, device info, these are used when connecting with the configurer
- this info is used to populate the hosts panel of the program with the device ips and ssh availability

the configurer:

- uses info gathered by the scanner to try an auto login on discovered devices
- retrieves detailed device info(make, model) 
- this info is used to populate the hosts panel of the program with the device models
- the user can login to devices that failed the auto login, the credentials entered this way are safely stored and will be used to auto login into devices
- the basic configuration options of the program are: setting hostname, setting ip address, vlan configuration, port forwarding, static ip leasing
- the basic configuration options for switches and routers are different
- switches: vlan configuration, setting ports for inter-vlan routing
- routers: outside/inside interface configuration, port forwarding, static ip leasing

the gui:

- zenmap style user interface
- hosts panel: located on the left side of the window, this narrow panel displays hosts that have been discovered, the user can scroll through all the devices if there is a large amount of them. the panel contains 4 informations for each host discovered, the ip address of the host, the model of the device, the connection information(disconnected, connecting..., connected), ssh port state(open, closed). the user, after clicking the desired host reaches the configuration panel
- configuration panel: located on the right side of the window, this panel uses the rest of the space left from the hosts panel, the user can configure the device using different input boxes, after the configuration information is entered, the user clicks the save button, which writes the configuration to the device, the user can also click the cancel button, which deletes the configuration information that was entered
- top panel: used to display information about the program, different selection menus, and a most used function(subnet scanning)
