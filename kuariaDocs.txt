kuaria - simple command line tool for network automation

current feature document 15/09/2025

2 main parts are required for the program to exist

the scanner:

- auto scans common subnets, if no hosts found, asks user to input the desired subnet.
- retrieves active ips, port 22 states, device info, these are used when connecting with the configurer

the configurer:

- uses info gathered by the scanner to try an auto login on discovered devices
- retrieves detailed device info(make, model) 
- the user can login to devices that failed the auto login, the credentials entered this way are safely stored and will be used to auto login into devices
- the basic configuration options of the program are: setting hostname, setting ip address, vlan configuration, port forwarding, static ip leasing
- the basic configuration options for switches and routers are different
- switches: vlan configuration, setting ports for inter-vlan routing
- routers: outside/inside interface configuration, port forwarding, static ip leasing

to do:

- separate kuaria demo into scanner, configurer and main
- add argparse to the program to take commands
- package it all into a distributable format
